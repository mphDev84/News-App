# News-App
A single page news app written in HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript. 
The app displays breaking, current and local news, as well as local weather and the current currency exchange rates. 
The free API used to retrieve data only allows for 1 API call per second. Therefore you'll notice that the data loads on the page gradually, as I've used
a 'setTimeout' function when calling the 'fetch' functions to allow for this.
